# Pecan

Pecan is a bar for macOS.  It was built to be highly configurable and — by default — reports the current workspace, network bandwidth, date, battery percentage and time.

## Instructions

Pecan requires [Übersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/).  Once Übersicht is installed, you can clone this repository to where your Übersicht bars are placed.

```
git clone https://github.com/zzzeyez/Pecan.git "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Übersicht/widgets/Pecan"
```

If Übersicht is running, then the bar should appear.

## Customization & Themes

#### Load themes

Pecan includes a tool `pecan-style` to allow users to save and load themes.  There are, by default, a few included themes.

To install `pecan-style`, first place it in your $PATH

```
ln -s "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Übersicht/widgets/Pecan/pecan-style" "/usr/local/bin"
```

Then if you want to load the Fillmore theme,  you do it like so:

```
pecan-style --load fillmore
```

You can also save and list themes by — respectively — using `--save` and `--list`. 

(These instructions assume your Übersicht widgets are stored in the default location.  If they are not, then you will need to manually edit line 14 to include the correct location and copy the script into your `$PATH` yourself.)

#### Create themes

Because Pecan is styled using CSS3 variables, the top lines of `style.css` can easily be edited to change properties like opacity, alignment, padding, colors and more.  If you are using this bar with Wal, then you should be editing `scss/style.scss` instead.

#### Pecan + Xanthia

If `Xanthia` is installed then it will now use `Pecan`'s CSS/SCSS files.

## Optional features
  
#### Network Bandwidth

Current download and upload speeds may be shown in the 2nd-to-left element via Ifstat.  If Ifstat is not found, then the current wifi network will be displayed instead.  To install Ifstat via Homebrew:

```
brew install ifstat
```
  
#### Workspaces

Current workspace ID can be shown on the left element if [ChunkWM](https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm) is installed, otherwise a power symbol will be shown instead.  To install ChunkWM:
  
```
brew tap koekeishiya/formulae
brew install chunkwm
````

## Wal

Pecan can pull a color palette generated by Wal using Sassc.  I have included a script, `wal-set`, that will perform this.
 
To install Sassc:

```
brew install sassc
```
  
And then you must change the username at the top of `scss/style.scss` to that of your own:

```
sed -i -e "s/zzzeyez/$USER/g" "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Übersicht/widgets/Pecan/scss/style.scss"
```
  
Now you can run the script to use Wal's palettes:

```
bash "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Übersicht/widgets/Pecan/wal-set"
```
